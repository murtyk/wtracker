For testing in dev:

1. Queue a job on wtracker:
   Make sure both wtracker and tapo_worker are NOT running.
   $ rails c (on wtracker)
   > AutoLeadsJob.new.delay.perform (run this 2 times)
2. Queue job on tapo_worker
   tapo_worker: rails s
   wtracker worker: bundle exec rake jobs:work
3. Run the jobs
   Shut down tapo_worker
   start wtracker rails s
   open 2 terminals on tapo_worker
   start workers bundle exec rake jobs:work
4. check for new leads
